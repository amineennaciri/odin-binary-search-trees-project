# odin-binary-search-trees-project
This is the binary search trees project from TOP(the odin project) Full Stack JavaScript course.

This project is about practicing the binary trees data structure using JavaScript.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in binary trees thinking using my knowledge around computer science.

Self-reflection and conclusion: this was an opportunity to practice binary trees theory.
